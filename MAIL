Subject IBM MQ – Kafka Connect setup completed | Blocker: AMQ Streams operator down
Hi <Manager Name>,

I wanted to update you on the IBM MQ ↔ Kafka integration activity.

I have completed the Kafka Connect and IBM MQ (NEFT) configuration on OpenShift and shared the related YAML files (KafkaConnect, MQ Source, MQ Sink) for review. The setup is aligned with our Kafka (Strimzi, KRaft) architecture and is ready for validation.

Currently, we are blocked because the **AMQ Streams (Strimzi) operator is down** in the cluster. The operator pod is in `ImagePullBackOff` state due to a registry image pull issue. Until the operator is up and running, KafkaConnect pods cannot be created, and connector testing cannot proceed.

The OpenShift admin team has been informed and is working on fixing the operator issue (image mirroring / registry access).

Once the operator is restored, KafkaConnect pods should come up automatically and we can immediately proceed with MQ → Kafka → MQ end-to-end testing.

Please let me know if you need any additional details.

Thanks,
Saadi

Hi <Manager Name>,

I wanted to update you on the IBM MQ ↔ Kafka integration activity.

I have completed the Kafka Connect and IBM MQ **NEFT** configuration on OpenShift and shared the related YAML files (KafkaConnect, MQ Source, MQ Sink) for review. The setup is aligned with our Kafka (Strimzi, KRaft) architecture and is ready for validation.

As discussed earlier with **Baboo sir**, the **RTGS flow is not configured yet**, as we are still awaiting clarity on RTGS queue/channel details from the MQ side. For now, the implementation and testing are limited to **NEFT only**.

Currently, we are blocked because the **AMQ Streams (Strimzi) operator is down** in the cluster. The operator pod is in `ImagePullBackOff` state due to a registry image pull issue. Until the operator is up and running, KafkaConnect pods cannot be created, and connector testing cannot proceed.

Once the operator is restored, KafkaConnect pods should come up automatically and we can immediately proceed with **NEFT MQ → Kafka → MQ end-to-end testing**. RTGS can be taken up after the required details are confirmed.

Please let me know if you need any additional details.

Thanks,
Saadi
-----------------

Below are the items required to proceed with RTGS integration:

RTGS Queue Manager confirmation

RTGS SVRCONN channel details (for inbound/outbound)

RTGS input and output queue names

Confirmation on message flow direction (MQ → Kafka / Kafka → MQ or both)

Subject : NEFT MQ Connectivity Issue – Channel Configuration Required

Hi Team,

We have completed Kafka Connect setup and both NEFT MQ Source and Sink connectors are running, but they are failing to connect to IBM MQ.

Observed Error (common for Source & Sink):
MQRC_UNKNOWN_CHANNEL_NAME (2540)
This indicates that the SVRCONN channels configured in Kafka Connect are not defined or not accessible on the MQ Queue Manager.

Details currently configured by us:
Queue Manager: SBI_NEFT
MQ Host: 10.176.10.213
Port: 2001
Source Channel: IPH.TO.SBIEPAY
Sink Channel: EPAY.TO.IPH
Connection mode: Client
TLS / User Auth: Not used

Request from MQ Team:
Please confirm:
Whether IPH.TO.SBIEPAY and EPAY.TO.IPH SVRCONN channels are created on SBI_NEFT
Channels are RUNNING and enabled for client connections
Channels are accessible from OpenShift network
Port 2001 listener is active for these channels
Once confirmed/fixed, we can immediately re-test end-to-end NEFT MQ ↔ Kafka flow.

Thanks,
Saadi

Dear Team,

We have create Server-connection at our end.

Server-connection : - SBIEPAY2.SVRCONN

NEFT MQ–Kafka Integration | Connectivity Established & Testing Successful

Hi Team,

This is to inform you that NEFT IBM MQ ↔ Kafka integration has been successfully completed and verified.

Closure Summary:

Kafka Connect setup on OpenShift is stable and healthy

IBM MQ Source and Sink connectors are running successfully

Connectivity established using MQ test SVRCONN channel (SBIEPAY2.SVRCONN)

End-to-end message flow verified:

MQ → Kafka (neft.raw.kafka.topic) ✔

Kafka topics created and accessible ✔

Kafka side validation completed via console consumer

Current Status:

NEFT integration: SUCCESSFUL (Tested & Verified)

Using MQ test queue (TEST) for validation

No infrastructure or Kafka-side blockers pending

Next Steps:

Await final production channel/queue details from MQ team

Proceed with production configuration once shared

RTGS integration to be taken up separately as discussed

Thanks to all teams for the coordination and support.

Regards,
Saadi/Omkar
